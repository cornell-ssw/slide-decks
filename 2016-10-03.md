# A Pythonic Whirlwind

---

## Goals and Non-Goals

- Non-goal: [Teach Python in one hour!](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)
- Goal: Give some perspective
    - Why Python?
    - What to learn about?
    - Where to learn more?

---

## Python basics

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys

def main(name="world"):
    print("Hello, {0}!".format(name))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(*sys.argv[1:])
```

---

## Syntactic features

- Shell style comments (start with `#`)
- Leading white space significant
- Colons for code blocks
- Style guide is [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (Python Enhancement Proposal)

---

## Deeper features: data

- Basic data types
    - Integers, floating point, complex, string, boolean, `None`
    - Dictionary, tuple, Linguistics
    - Objects, functions
- Supports [higher-order functions][wiki-hof] (and [decorators][dec-tutorial])
- Support for matrices ([NumPy][numpy-home]) and tables ([pandas][pandas-home])
- [MATLAB-ish][numpy-matlab] array ops (e.g. slicing)

[wiki-hof]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function

[pandas-home]: http://pandas.pydata.org/
[numpy-matlab]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html

---

## Deeper features: modules/packages

- [Docstrings][docstrings] everywhere
- [File-based module system][modules]
- Packaging systems ([`distutils`][distutils], [PyPI][pypi])
- "[Batteries includes][batteries]" stdlib

[docstrings]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

---

## Deeper features: functions and objects

- Can manipulate functions, objects, classes as data
    - Especially useful with [decorators][dec-tutorial]
- Obeys ["duck typing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing)
    - Pro: Don't have to satisfy type checker to run
    - Con: Hard to catch errors by static analysis[^1]

[^1]: This may be changing; see e.g. [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and [mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/)

---

## Deeper features: iteration and mapping

- Lots of ways to do functional mapping
    - [`map`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map) command
    - Python [generators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) for generalized [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
    - [List comprehension and dictionary comprehension](http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Comprehensions.html)

---

## Deeper features: iteration and mapping

```python
xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Produce generator for list [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
ys = map(lambda x: x + 1, xs)

# Produce generator for list [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
zs = [x+1 for x in xs]

# Iterate over the collections with generalized for
for x, y, z in zip(xs, ys, zs):
    print(x, y, z)
```

### Making it fast

![left 75%](http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920028963/lrg.jpg)

[*High-Performance Python*][hiperf-book] is about all the tricks you can use to make Python run fast, including specialized interpreters like [PyPy][pypy] and compilers like [Cython][cython], among others.  Some of the content will be obsolete soon; the technology moves fast.  Nonetheless, I think this is valuable stuff to learn.

- 1997: Paul Dubois takes over numeric
- 2000: Oliphant, Jones, Peterson start SciPy (from MultiPack)
- 2002: numarray competes with numeric
- 2006: Oliphant introduces NumPy

---

## Recent events

# Role of Python

---

## Which Python?

There are many Pythons

- CPython - main version
- [PyPy][pypy] - JIT for statically-typed RPython
- [Jython][jython] - runs on JVM
- [IronPython][iron-python] - integrates with .NET
- [PythonNet][python-net] - same

We assume CPython.

[jython]: http://www.jython.org/
[iron-python]: http://ironpython.net/
[python-net]: http://pythonnet.github.io/

---

## Batteries included

Python offers good-enough replacements for

- Control scripts in shell or Tcl
- Perl/Awk/etc data scripts
- Plotters (with [Matplotlib][matplotlib] and company)
- [MATLAB][numpy-matlab] (with [SciPy][scipy]/[NumPy][numpy])
- Mathematica-style notebooks (with [Jupyter][jupyter])

[matplotlib]: http://matplotlib.org/
[scipy]: https://www.scipy.org/
[numpy]: http://www.numpy.org/
[jupyter]: http://jupyter.org/

---

## Crazy glue

Long history of tools to bridge performance gap:

- [SWIG][swig] and [f2py][f2py] (mid 90s): wrapper generator
- [Cython][cython] (previously Pyrex): C/Python hybrid
- [Numba][numba]: recent LLVM-based JIT accelerator
- and many others

[swig]: http://www.swig.org/
[f2py]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/
[numba]: http://numba.pydata.org/

---

# What to learn?

---

## NumPy and SciPy

These are the base of the Python scientific ecosystem.

- [NumPy][numpy] is about array manipulation and basic LA
- [SciPy][scipy] has more high-level scientific codes

---

## Visualization tools

![left](http://matplotlib.org/_images/surface3d_demo4.png)

- [Matplotlib][matplotlib] is default
- [Pandas plot][pandas-plot] builds on matplotlib
- [Seaborn][seaborn] also builds on matplotlib
- [Bokeh][bokeh] for interactive web plots
- [Altair][altair] is the new kid on the block

[pandas-plot]: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/visualization.html
[seaborn]: http://seaborn.pydata.org/
[bokeh]: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/
[altair]: https://altair-viz.github.io/

---

## pandas

![left 75%](http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920023784/lrg.jpg)

The pandas library is Python's answer to the R data frame object.  There [is a book][pandas-book], too.

[pandas-book]: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do

---

## [Scikits](https://scikits.appspot.com/scikits)

- Too specialized for the main SciPy distribution
- Many domains: finance, audio, geoscience, vision, ML, ...
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) may be the best known

---

## [Cython][cython]

![left 75%](http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920033431/lrg.jpg)

- Compiles Python down to C
- C type annotations for faster code
- Or syntax to call C routines
- [O'Reilly inevitably has a book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033431.do)

---

## [Numba][numba]

![left 75%](http://numba.pydata.org/_static/numba_blue_icon_rgb.png)

Add `@jit` before your function defs, and then a miracle occurs.

```python
from numba import jit
from numpy import arange

# jit decorator tells Numba to compile this function.
# Arg types inferred by Numba when function is called.
@jit
def sum2d(arr):
    M, N = arr.shape
    result = 0.0
    for i in range(M):
        for j in range(N):
            result += arr[i,j]
    return result

a = arange(9).reshape(3,3)
print(sum2d(a))
```

---

## [SymPy][sympy] and [SAGE][sage]

- [SAGE][sage]: Symbolic tools a la Magma, Maple, Mathematica
- [SymPy][sympy]: Lightweight symbolic math library
- [SAGE][sage] includes [SymPy][sympy]

[sympy]: http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html
[sage]: http://www.sagemath.org/

---

## Package managers

There have been many package managers over time: distutils, setuptools, distribute, pip/virtualenv, and conda.  Outside of the scientific community, pip packages seem to be the standard.  But building numerical codes is generally a problem, and this is part of why [conda was created][why-conda].

[why-conda]: http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.com/2013/12/why-i-promote-conda.html

---

## Parallelism

- Python threads support concurrency, *not* parallelism
- For parallelism on one node: [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html)
- But [many other options](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing), whether one node or cluster

---

# Jupyter notebooks

# Jupyter

![left](http://jupyter.org/assets/jupyterpreview.png)

- Mix text, code, output
- Interact via web interface
- Works with many languages
    - Started with Python
    - Then *Ju*lia, *Pyt*hon, and *R*
    - Now many others as well

## Jupyter in the news!

![left](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/avm_image_sqls/binaries/45/page/ligo20160211a.jpg?1455158181)

The [LIGO Open Science Center (LOSC)](https://losc.ligo.org/about/) released [tutorial notebooks](https://losc.ligo.org/tutorials/) on the signal processing on the LIGO data -- you can reproduce it for yourself!


---

## Role of notebooks

- Notebooks are great for notes, tutorials, one-off analyses
- Less useful for
    - Developing programs or modules
    - Running large-scale simulations
- Does not replace [Make][make], [SnakeMake][snakemake], [PyDoIt][pydoit], etc

[make]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
[snakemake]: https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home
[pydoit]: http://pydoit.org/

# Concluding thoughts

---

## Why Python?

- Simple to learn
    - There is a reason we use it for CS 1110!
- Widely adopted
    - Lots of libraries (especially for computational science)
    - Many collaborators/students will already know it
    - You can find answers to common questions easily
- Serves as a useful glue language

---

## Why not Python?

- Too slow?
    - Maybe too slow for numerical kernels...
    - But it makes a nice interface
    - And Cython/Numba make it faster than you might think
- I wish there were better static analysis tools
    - But this may be changing
    - And I only wish for this sometimes!

---

## What I think

You should learn some Python

- It is easy to get started
- It is ubiquitous
- It makes a good programming "Swiss army knife"
