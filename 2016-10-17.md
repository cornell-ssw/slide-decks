## What is a computer system?

Typical laptop:

- A few cores and a few GB memory
- Disk or SSD
- Battery pack (battery life trumps cores!)
- Standard peripherals: monitor, keyboard, mouse
- External connectivity: NIC, HDMI, USB

## What is a computer system?

[Totient](https://cornell-ssw.github.io/cluster.html) is typical small cluster:

- Several rack-mounted servers (12 core, 32 GB RAM)
- Xeon Phi accelerators
- Fast Ethernet interconnect
- Local and network mounted file systems

## What is a computer system?

Typical modern supercomputer is:

- High-end commodity nodes
- Custom network

## What is a computer system?

Cloud infrastructure

- Rack-mounted servers in data centers
- Storage is typically disaggregated
- Used to run VMs: the "machine" and the HW are separate!

## What is a computer system?
### Hardware resources?

- I/O peripherals (irrelevant today)
- Compute: CPU cores, accelerators
- Memory: Cache and RAM
- Storage: Disk, SSD, etc
- Network

How can you share these resources?

## What is a computer system?
### OS and associated utilities?

The operating system provides

- Uniform programming abstractions for HW resources
- Scheduling of resources to processes
- Mechanisms for
    - Accessing hardware resources
    - Communicating with other processes
    - Isolation between processes

---

## What is a computer system?

- Hardware?
- OS abstraction of hardware?
- A higher-level platform for running programs?

> All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection.
-- David Wheeler

## From physical to logical

OS already abstracts the hardware:

- I/O peripherals: "Print to X"
- Compute: Hyperthreading, multitasking
- Memory: Virtual memory
- Storage: Dropbox, NFS, etc
- Network: Virtual NICs

---

## Another level of indirection

![fit](https://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/190004/virtualization-icon.png)

## Another level of indirection

- OS: Share HW resources between processes
- Hypervisor: Share HW resources between virtual machines
    - Each VM has an independent OS, utilities, libraries
    - Sharing HW across VMs improves utilization
    - Separating VM from HW improves portability

Sharing hardware across VMs is key to Amazon, Azure, Google clouds.

---

## The Virtual Machine: CPU + memory

- Sharing across processes with same OS is old
    - OS-supported pre-emptive multi-tasking
    - Virtual memory abstractions with HW support
        - Page tables, TLB
- Sharing HW between systems is newer
    - Today: CPU virtualization with near zero overhead
    - Backed by extended virtual memory support
        - DMA remapping, extended page tables

---

## The Virtual Machine: Storage

- Network attached storage around for a long time
    - Issue: The I/O blender
    - Disks are good at big sequential reads
    - Lots of independent access $$\implies$$ thrashing
- SSD-enabled machines are increasingly common

---

## The Virtual Machine: Network

- Hard to get full-speed access via VM!
    - Issue: Sharing peripherals with direct memory access?
- Hardware support is improving (e.g.~SR-IOV standards)
- Still a potential pain point (esp for networking)

---

## The Virtual Machine: Accelerators?

I don't understand how these would be virtualized!
But I know people are doing it.

---

## Hypervisor options

- Type 1 (bare metal) vs type 2 (run guest OS atop host OS)
  - Not always a clear distinction (e.g. KVM somewhere between?)
  - You may have used Type 2 (e.g. Parallels, VirtualBox, etc)
- Common large-scale choices
  - KVM (used by Google cloud)
  - Xen (used by Amazon cloud)
  - HyperV (used by Azure)
  - vmWare (used in many commercial clouds)

## Performance implications
### The good

VMs perform well enough for many commercial workloads:

- Hypervisor CPU overheads are pretty low (absent sharing)
- [May now be within a few percent on LINPACK-style loads][hp-report]
- [VMWare agrees with this][vmware-report]
- Virtual memory (a mature tech) is being extended appropriately

## Performance implications
### The bad

Virtualization does have performance impacts:

- Contention between VMs has nontrivial overheads
- Untuned VMs [may miss important memory features][ibm-report]
- Mismatched scheduling of VMs can slow multi-CPU runs
- I/O virtualization is still costly

It probably does not make sense to do big PDE solves on VMs yet.

---

## Performance implications

VM performance is a *fast* moving target:

- VMs are important for isolation and utilization
    - Important for economics of rented infrastructure
- Economic importance drives a lot
    - Big topic of academic systems research
    - Lots of industry and open source R&D (HW and SW)

Scientific HPC *will* ultimately benefit even if it is not the driver.

---

## VM performance punchline

- VM computing in clouds will not give "bare metal" performance
    - If I get 32 cores + 256 GB RAM, do I care about 10% penalty?
- Try it before you knock it
    - Much depends on the workload
    - And remember: performance comparisons are hard!
    - And the picture will change next year anyhow

## Why virtualize?
### A scientific SW perspective

A not-atypical coding day:

1. Build my code (four different languages, countless libraries)
2. Doesn't work; install missing library
3. Library requires a different version of another dependency
4. Install new version, breaking a different package
5. Swear, take a coffee break
6. Go to 1

---

## Why virtualize?
### Application isolation

- Desiderata: Codes operate independently on same HW
    - Isolated HW use: memory spaces, processes, etc (OS handles)
    - Isolated SW use: dependencies, dynamic libraries, etc (OS shrugs)
- Many different tools for isolation
    - Virtual machine: strong isolation, heavyweight solution
    - Python [virtualenv][py-venv], [conda environments][py-conda], [environment modules][modules]: language level, only partial isolation

[py-venv]: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/
[py-conda]: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html
[modules]: http://modules.sourceforge.net/

---

## Why virtualize?
### Application portability

- Desiderata: Code developed on my laptop runs elsewhere
    - Even if "elsewhere" prefers a different Linux distribution
- What about automatic configuration ([autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html), [CMake](https://cmake.org/))?
    - Great at finding *some* libraries that satisfy dependencies
    - Maintenance woes: bug on a system I can't reproduce?
- Solution: Package code and all dependencies in a VM?
    - But what about performance?  And image size?

---

## Containers

- Instead of virtualizing all HW, virtualize the OS
- Container image includes library dependencies, config files, etc
- A running container has its own
    - Root filesystem (no sharing libraries across containers)
    - Process space, inter-process communication, TCP sockets, ...
- Can run on VM or on bare metal

## Container landscape

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) dominates
- [rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/) is an up-and-coming alternative
- Several others (see [this comparison](https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/latest/rkt-vs-other-projects.html))
- Multiple efforts on [containers for HPC](http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Singularity-A-Container-for-HPC)
    - [Shifter](https://www.nersc.gov/research-and-development/user-defined-images/): Docker-like user-defined images for HPC systems
    - [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/): Competing system

---

## Containers vs VMs?

- VMs: Different operating systems on same hardware
    - What if I want Windows and Linux together on one machine?
    - This is a good reason for running VMs locally, too!
- VMs: Strong isolation between jobs sharing hardware (security)
    - Operating system is supposed to isolate jobs
    - But what about shared OS, one malicious user with a root kit?
    - Hypervisor provides smaller attack surface
- Containers: one OS, weaker isolation, but lower overhead

# XaaS and the cloud

![fit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg/2000px-AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg.png)

---

## IaaS
### Infrastructure as a Service

- Low-level computing for rent
    - Computers (VMs or bare metal)
    - Network (you pay for bandwidth)
    - Storage (virtual disks, storage buckets, databases)
- The focus of our discussion so far

---

## PaaS
### Platform as a Service

- Programmable environments one step above raw machines
- Example: Wakari and other Python notebook hosts

---

## SaaS
### Software as a Service

- Relatively fixed software package (usually with web interface)
- Example: GMail

---

## The big three for XaaS

- Amazon Web Services (AWS): first mover, GPUs
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): better prices?
- Microsoft Azure: only one with Infiniband instances

---

# Choosing a platform

![](http://s0.geograph.org.uk/photos/28/84/288462_4d2dc229.jpg)

---

## Questions to ask

- What type of workload do I have?
    - Big memory but modest core count?
    - Embarassingly parallel?
    - GPU friendly?
- How much data?  Data transfer is not always free!
- How will I interact with the system?  SSH alone?  GUIs?  Web?
- What about licensed software?

---

## Standard options beyond the laptop

- Local clusters and servers ([totient](https://cornell-ssw.github.io/cluster.html), several others around Cornell)
- Public cloud VMs (Amazon, Google, Azure)
    - Will discuss over next few weeks
    - Can pay money or write proposal for credits
- Public cloud bare metal ([Nimbix][nimbix], [Sabalcore][sabalcore], [PoD][pod])
    - Good if bare-metal parallel performance an issue
    - Might want to compare to [CAC offerings](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/)
- Supercomputer ([XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/), [DOE](http://science.energy.gov/ascr/facilities/accessing-ascr-facilities/)): discuss in the spring
